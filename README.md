1. Overview
Credit score prediction is a machine learning problem where we aim to predict an individual's creditworthiness based on their financial history and personal information. Financial institutions use credit scores to assess the risk of lending money to a person or business.

2. Why is it Important?
For Lenders (Banks, NBFCs, Credit Card Companies): Helps in decision-making for loan approvals, interest rates, and credit limits.
For Borrowers: Allows individuals to improve their financial habits to secure better loan opportunities.
For Risk Management: Reduces defaults and financial losses for institutions.
3. Problem Definition
Given a dataset containing financial details like past loan history, payment behavior, credit utilization, and demographic details, the goal is to predict the credit score of an individual. The problem can be framed as:

Classification: Predicting creditworthiness categories (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent).
Regression: Predicting an exact credit score (e.g., a score between 300-850).
4. Key Factors Affecting Credit Score
Payment History: Timely payments vs. late payments.
Credit Utilization: The ratio of used credit to total available credit.
Credit Age: The duration for which credit accounts have been active.
Number of Inquiries: Hard inquiries from lenders affect scores negatively.
Debt-to-Income Ratio: Measures financial stability.
5. Challenges in Credit Score Prediction
Data Imbalance: Most people have good credit scores, fewer have poor ones.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from financial data.
Regulatory Constraints: Privacy concerns and legal compliance.
Model Interpretability: Financial institutions need explainable models to justify decisions.
